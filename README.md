# OpenGL Tutorial
I Have created this directory for anyone who wants to learn the basics of OpenGL.
I Write the code in Visual Code in a Linux Ubuntu environment, so it's all configured and setup for Linux users ðŸ˜„.
Anyway i've added in the directory all of the necessary stuff to make and build the executable using cmake, but the executable is included already so no need for all of the compilation and linking headache.

## Run Executable
To run the executable navigate to 'build/' folder and run from the terminal:
``./main.o``
