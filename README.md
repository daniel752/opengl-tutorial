# OpenGL Tutorial
I Have created this directory for anyone who wants to learn the basics of OpenGL.
I Wrote the code in Visual Code in a Linux Ubuntu environment, so it's all configured and setup for Linux users ðŸ˜„.
Anyway i've added in the directory all of the necessary stuff to make and build the executable using cmake, but the executable is included already so no need for all of the compilation and linking headache.

## Clone Repository
From the terminal run one of the options:<br>
- HTTPS: ``git clone https://github.com/daniel752/opengl-tutorial.git``<br>
- SSH: ``git@github.com:daniel752/opengl-tutorial.git``

## Build And Run Executable
### Build
- From the root directory for that specific tutorial ([path]/opengl-tutorial/draw-shape/, [path]/opengl-tutorial/init-window/, etc) run:<br> 
``mkdir build && cd build``<br>
- After build directory was created run:<br>
``cmake ..``<br>
- After that cmake will generate a Makefile in build/ directory,from build/ directory run:<br>
 ``make``<br>
## Run
From the 'build/' directory run:<br>
``./main.o``
